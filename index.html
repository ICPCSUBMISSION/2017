        <p class="text-justify">
            Software systems have been discontinued or restructure due to the presence of design problems. However, identifying design problems is a challenging task. For instance, developers have to locate and analyze several elements to identify a single design problem. In order to help the developers with this task, we investigate how they perform it nowadays. We conducted a study in which we observed developers identifying design problems in systems that they have knowledge of the implementation and in systems they did not have knowledge. Our results indicate that developers face similar issues in both scenarios. They also combine different strategies to identify design problems. One of the strategies regards of the use of code smells. When they used the code smells, they identified design problems that the developers that have knowledge of the systems could not identify. Our results are relevant because they shed lights on the way the developers identify design problems. Thus, other studies can focus on improving the identification based on our findings.

        <h3 class="page-header" id="scenarios">Studied Scenarios and Participants</h3>
        We conducted a qualitative study to observe how developers identify design problems in the source code. In order to conduct the study, we observed developers in two scenarios:
        
        
        <h4><u>Scenario 1: Developers that are familiar with the analyzed systems</u></h4>
        
        <p class="text-justify"> 
            The first scenario comprises developers allocated to identify design problems in systems with which they are familiar, i.e., systems that they implemented. In order to select developers
            for this scenario, we searched for software companies that could provide us with: (i) developers, and (ii) systems where identification of design problems was currentlyseen as critical.
            We selected two software companies, in which provided us five software systems. Table I summarizes the characterization of the software companies.</p>

        <h4><u>Scenario 2: Developers that are unfamiliar with the analyzed systems</u></h4>

        <p class="text-justify">
            The second scenario comprises developers assigned to identify design problems in systems with which they are unfamiliar, i.e., systems that they did not implement. 
            In order to select developers for this scenario, we recruited a set of developers, and we asked them to answer a questionnaire. The goal was to determine which of 
            them were eligible for the study. The questionnaire covers information to characterize the developers about their education level and knowledge of Java programming 
            and code smells. In order to select a developer for the study, he would need to meet some requirements.Thus, we analyzed their answers based on the following requirements:

            <ol>

                <li>R1. Four years or more of experience with software development and maintenance. We have chosen four years because this is the average time used by companies such
                    as Yahoo <a href="#yahoo">(Yahoo, 2016)</a> and Twitter <a href="#twitter">(Twitter, 2016)</a> to classify a developer as experienced.</li>

                <li>R2. No previous knowledge about S6 and S7.</li>

                <li>R3. At least basic knowledge about code smells.</li>

                <li>R4. At least intermediary knowledge on Java programming. </li>

            </ol>

        </p>

        <p class="text-justify">
            We included in the questionnaire a description of our definition of knowledge level, thereby allowing developers to have a similar interpretation of the possible answers.
            Table II presents the definition of knowledge level that developers received.

        <h3 class="page-header" id="dp">Design Problems and Code Smells</h3>

        <p class="text-justify>">
            We conducted a qualitative study to observe how developers identify design problems in the source code. We provided developers with an initial list of code smells affecting the systems. The developers had the freedom to use or not the initial list of code smells. Thus, we could investigate if developers rely on code smells as a dominant strategy to identify design problems and to what extent they can identify design problem using code smells. Following we present the design problems and the code smells used in our study.
        </p>

        <h4><u>Design Problems</u></h4>

        <p class="text-justify">
            A design problem is a part of the software design (a design fragment) that negatively impacts one or more quality attributes, such as comprehensibility, maintainability and performance <a href="#bar">(Bar, 1998)</a>;<a href="#ciupke">Ciupke, 1999</a>;<a href="suryanarayana">Suryanarayana 2014</a>;<a href="#trifu">Trifu, 2007)</a>. Following we present a brief description of thes design problems used in our study. We highlight that we let clear to developers that they were allowed to identify other types ofdesign problems.

        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Ambiguous Interface:</strong> Interface of a design component that offers only a general, ambiguous entry-point that provides non-cohesive services, thereby complicating the clients' logic.</li>

            <li><strong>Component Overload:</strong> Design components that fulfill too many responsibilities.</li>

            <li><strong>Cyclic Dependency:</strong> Two or more design components that directly or indirectly depend on each other.</li>

            <li><strong>Delegating Abstraction:</strong> An abstraction that exists only for passing messages from one abstraction to another.</li>

            <li><strong>Fat Interface:</strong> Interface that is overloaded with many clients accessing it. That is, an interface with "too many clients".</li>

            <li><strong>Scattered Concern:</strong> Multiple components that are responsible for realizing a crosscutting concern.</li>

            <li><strong>Unused Abstraction:</strong> Design abstraction that is either unreachable or  never used in the system.</li>

            <li><strong>Unwanted Dependency:</strong> Dependency that violates an intended design rule.</li>

        </ul>

        <h4><u>Code Smells</u></h4>

        <p class="text-justify">
            A code smell is a structure in the implementation of the program that possibly indicates a design problem <a href="#fowler">(Fowler, 1999)</a>. In this study, we have focus on 15 types of code smells. We present the definition of the code smells following:

        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Blob Class:</strong> Long and complex class that centralizes the intelligence of the system.</li>

            <li><strong>Class Data Should Be Private:</strong> A class exposing its fields, violating the principle of data hiding.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Complex Class:</strong> A class having at least one method having a high cyclomatic complexity.</li>

            <li><strong>Data Class:</strong> A class has this code smell when it has only fields, getting and setting methods for the fields, and nothing else. The aim is to hold data and, consequently, be manipulated by other classes.</li>

            <li><strong>Divergent Change:</strong> This code smell occurs when one class is commonly changed in different ways for different reasons.</li>

            <li><strong>Feature Envy:</strong> Feature envy occurs in a class when the method of that class seems more interested in a class other than the one it actually belongs.</li>

            <li><strong>God Class:</strong> This code smell occurs when the class centralizes more the one functionality, realizing more than one purpose.</li>

            <li><strong>Lazy Class: A class having very small dimension, few methods and with low complexity.</strong> </li>

            <li><strong>Long Method:</strong> This code smell occurs when a method has grown too large, containing too many lines of code.</li>

            <li><strong>Long Parameter List:</strong> This code smell occurs in a method that has a long list of parameters, in which makes readability and code quality worse.</li>

            <li><strong>Message Chain:</strong> A long chain of method invocations is performed to implement a class functionality.</li>
            <li><strong>Refused Bequest:</strong> A subclass that uses only some of the methods and properties inherited from its parents.</li>

            <li><strong>Shotgun Surgery:</strong> This code smell is the opposite of Divergent Change. It happens when every time a kind of change is made in the code, that change triggers many little changes in many different classes.</li>

            <li><strong>Spaghetti Code:</strong> A class implementing complex methods interacting with them, with no parameters, using global variables.</li>

            <li><strong>Speculative Generality:</strong> A class declared as abstract having very few children classes that use its methods.</li>

        </ul>
