        <p class="text-justify">Code smells in a program represent indications of structural quality problems, which can be addressed by software refactoring. There is an explicit assumption that software refactoring improves the structural quality of a program by reducing its
            density of code smells. However, little has been reported about whether and to what extent developers neglect or end up creating code smells through refactoring. This paper reports a longitudinal study intended to address this gap. We analyze
            how often commonly-used refactoring types affect the density of 13 types of code smells along the version histories of 23 projects. Our findings are based on the analysis of 29,318 refactorings distributed in 10 different types. Even though
            more than 80% of the refactorings touched smelly elements, 63.2% did not reduce their occurrences. Surprisingly, only 12.3% of refactorings removed smells, while 24.5% induced the introduction of new ones. More than 95% of such refactoring-induced
            smells were not removed in successive commits. All these findings suggest that refactorings tend to more frequently introduce long- living smells instead of fully eliminating existing ones. Also, we analyzed which types of refactoring affects
            specific types of code smells more often. Through this analysis, we were able to identify refactoring-smell pairs which occurred more frequently.</p>
