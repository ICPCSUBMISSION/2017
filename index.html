        Following sections present the complementary information regarding the paper:

				<li><a href="#abstract">Abstract</a>: presents the questionnaire submitted to developers and how we used it to create the list of design problems and code elements.</li>

        <h3 class="page-header" id="abstract">Abstract</h3>

        <p class="text-justify">
            Software systems have been discontinued or restructure due to the presence of design problems. However, identifying design problems is a challenging task. For instance, developers have to locate and analyze several elements to identify a single design problem. In order to help the developers with this task, we investigate how they perform it nowadays. We conducted a study in which we observed developers identifying design problems in systems that they have knowledge of the implementation and in systems they did not have knowledge. Our results indicate that developers face similar issues in both scenarios. They also combine different strategies to identify design problems. One of the strategies regards of the use of code smells. When they used the code smells, they identified design problems that the developers that have knowledge of the systems could not identify. Our results are relevant because they shed lights on the way the developers identify design problems. Thus, other studies can focus on improving the identification based on our findings.

        <h3 class="page-header" id="scenarios">Studied Scenarios and Participants</h3>
        We conducted a qualitative study to observe how developers identify design problems in the source code. In order to conduct the study, we observed developers in two scenarios:
        
        
        <h4><u>Scenario 1: Developers that are familiar with the analyzed systems</u></h4>
        
        <p class="text-justify"> 
            The first scenario comprises developers allocated to identify design problems in systems with which they are familiar, i.e., systems that they implemented. In order to select developers
            for this scenario, we searched for software companies that could provide us with: (i) developers, and (ii) systems where identification of design problems was currentlyseen as critical.
            We selected two software companies, in which provided us five software systems. Table I summarizes the characterization of the software companies.</p>

        <h4><u>Scenario 2: Developers that are unfamiliar with the analyzed systems</u></h4>

        <p class="text-justify">
            The second scenario comprises developers assigned to identify design problems in systems with which they are unfamiliar, i.e., systems that they did not implement. 
            In order to select developers for this scenario, we recruited a set of developers, and we asked them to answer a questionnaire. The goal was to determine which of 
            them were eligible for the study. The questionnaire covers information to characterize the developers about their education level and knowledge of Java programming 
            and code smells. In order to select a developer for the study, he would need to meet some requirements.Thus, we analyzed their answers based on the following requirements:

            <ol>

                <li>R1. Four years or more of experience with software development and maintenance. We have chosen four years because this is the average time used by companies such
                    as Yahoo and Twitter to classify a developer as experienced.</li>

                <li>R2. No previous knowledge about S6 and S7.</li>

                <li>R3. At least basic knowledge about code smells.</li>

                <li>R4. At least intermediary knowledge on Java programming. </li>

            </ol>

            <br>

            We included in the questionnaire a description of our definition of knowledge level, thereby allowing developers to have a similar interpretation of the possible answers.
            Table II presents the definition of knowledge level that developers received.
